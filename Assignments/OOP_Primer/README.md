# OOP Terminology.

A list of 33 terms that haved been defined in relation to OOP.

## Abstract Classes and Interfaces

A class that can can create templates for a base class that can be shared between derived classes

## Abstraction

Restricting access to information from outside sources such as through private and protected modifiers.

## Access Modifiers (Public, Private, Protected)

Access modifiers are used to control what class members can be accessed by other parts of a program outside of the base class.

## Attributes / Properties

The data values within a class or object that define its characteristics.

## Class Variable

A variable that is shared by every instance of a class.


## Classes and Objects

A class is a template for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

## Collections and Iterators

A collection is a group of objects, and an iterator is a way to access those objects one by one.

## Composition

A design technique where one object is made up of other objects, essentially creating a "has-a" relationship between them, meaning an object "has" a part that is another object

## Constructors and Destructors

Constructors and destructors are special member functions in object-oriented programming languages like C++ and Python that manage the lifecycle of an object.

## Design Patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer)

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design.

## Encapsulation

The bundling data and the methods that operate on it within a class.

## Exception Handling

the process of managing and responding to runtime errors or unusual conditions in a
program in a structured way

## File I/O in OOP

Refers to reading from and writing to files using classes, objects, and methods.

## Friends

Classes that have access to other classes' private and protected parts.

## Generics and Templates

They are advanced programming features in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that enable developers to create flexible and reusable code.

## Inheritance
Allows a base class to pass on traits to a child class granting a Is-A relationship

## Instance Variable
An instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has its own unique copy

## Member Variable
A member variable is a variable that is declared inside a class and is accessible to all members (methods) of that class

## Memory Management (Garbage Collection, Pointers)

In programming refers to the process of efficiently allocating, using, and deallocating 
memory during the execution of a program

## Method Overloading

Is a feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameters.

## Method

A method is a function that is defined within a class and is used to perform specific operations related to the objects of that class.

## Multiple Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a class can inherit from more than one parent class.

## Multithreading in OOP (time permitting)

Multithreading in OOP is a programming concept where multiple threads (or "lightweight processes") are executed concurrently within a single process.

## Object Relationships (Association, Aggregation, Composition)

Object relationships describe how objects of different classes interact with each other.

## Object-Oriented Design Principles

Are a set of guidelines and practices aimed at creating clean, maintainable, scalable, and flexible object-oriented code.

## Operator Overloading

Operator Overloading is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows you to define custom behaviors for operator (such as +, -, *, ==, etc.) when they are applied to objects of a class.

## Overloading

Overloading in programming refers to the ability to define multiple methods or operators with the same name but different implementations.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

## Public / Private / Protected

Public: Can be accessed by any other part of the code.

Private: Can only be accessed by the class that it is declared in and friend classes.

Protected: Can be accessed by friend classes and derived classes.

## SOLID Principles

S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Static (Methods and Variables)

The term static refers to a feature that allows methods or variables to be associated with a class itself, rather than instances of the class.

## Testing in OOP (Unit Testing, Test-Driven Development)

Is crucial for ensuring that your code behaves as expected, is maintainable, and is free from bugs. It is the process of rooting out bugs in code.

## UML Diagrams and Modeling

UML Diagrams and Modeling are integral parts of Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They provide a visual representation of the system, helping developers, designers, and stakeholders understand and communicate the  structure, behavior, and relationships within a software application.

## Virtual

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the term virtual generally refers to methods or functions that can be overridden in derived (sub) classes.
